Official repository of NICK, ESP8266 Nixie Clock

# About the project
Nick is a nixie clock based on ESP8266 designed to be as simple as possible and as compact as possible. And it's open source.  
  
**As of now, you can take a look at the schematics and make your own clock. Once I have final pcbs and firmware, I will share all of them here together with components list.**
