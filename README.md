Official repository of NICK, ESP8266 Nixie Clock

# About the project
Nick is an open source nixie clock based on ESP8266 designed to be as simple as possible and as compact as possible. There are three versions of Nick you can make, one is direct driven IN-12, second version is duplexed IN-12 and finally a tiny duplexed IN-16 version.

**UPDATE 14/4/2020: Better ESP32 version is in the works. ESP8266 can occasionaly stutter in multiplex, especially if the wifi signal is bad, so I can't recommend it. If you want to use ESP8266, choose the direct-drive version with 4 x 74141 IC which will always be flawless. Or use separate microcontroller for the multiplexing.**
