Official repository of NICK, ESP8266 Nixie Clock

# About the project
Nick is an open source nixie clock based on ESP8266 designed to be as simple as possible and as compact as possible. There are three versions of Nick you can make, one is direct driven IN-12, second version is duplexed IN-12 and finally a tiny duplexed IN-16 version.

**As of now, you can take a look at the schematics and make your own clock. Once I finish polishing the pcbs and firmware, I will share all of them here together with components list. Watch this repository to get notified.**
